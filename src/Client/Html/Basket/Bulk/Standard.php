	/** client/html/basket/bulk/name
	 * Class name of the used bulk order client implementation
	 *
	 * Each default HTML client can be replace by an alternative imlementation.
	 * To use this implementation, you have to set the last part of the class
	 * name as configuration value so the client factory knows which class it
	 * has to instantiate.
	 *
	 * For example, if the name of the default class is
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Client\Html\Basket\Bulk\Standard
	 *
	 * and you want to replace it with your own version named
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Client\Html\Basket\Bulk\Myorder
	 *
	 * then you have to set the this configuration option:
	 *
	 *  client/html/basket/bulk/name = Myorder
	 *
	 * The value is the last part of your own class name and it's case sensitive,
	 * so take care that the configuration value is exactly named like the last
	 * part of the class name.
	 *
	 * The allowed characters of the class name are A-Z, a-z and 0-9. No other
	 * characters are possible! You should always start the last part of the class
	 * name with an upper case character and continue only with lower case characters
	 * or numbers. Avoid chamel case names like "MyBasket"!
	 *
	 * @param string Last part of the class name

	/** client/html/basket/bulk/template-body
	 * Relative path to the HTML body template of the bulk order client.
	 *
	 * The template file contains the HTML code and processing instructions
	 * to generate the result shown in the body of the frontend. The
	 * configuration string is the path to the template file relative
	 * to the templates directory (usually in templates/client/html).
	 *
	 * You can overwrite the template file configuration in extensions and
	 * provide alternative templates. These alternative templates should be
	 * named like the default one but suffixed by
	 * an unique name. You may use the name of your project for this. If
	 * you've implemented an alternative client class as well, it
	 * should be suffixed by the name of the new class.
	 *
	 * @param string Relative path to the template creating code for the HTML page body

	/** client/html/basket/bulk/template-header

	 * of the rendered page in the frontend. The configuration string is the
