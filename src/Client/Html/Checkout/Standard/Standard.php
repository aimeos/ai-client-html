	 * Class name of the used checkout standard client implementation
	 *
	 * Each default HTML client can be replace by an alternative imlementation.
	 * To use this implementation, you have to set the last part of the class
	 * name as configuration value so the client factory knows which class it
	 * has to instantiate.
	 *
	 * For example, if the name of the default class is
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Client\Html\Checkout\Standard\Standard
	 *
	 * and you want to replace it with your own version named
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Client\Html\Checkout\Standard\Mycheckout
	 *
	 * then you have to set the this configuration option:
	 *
	 *  client/html/checkout/standard/name = Mycheckout
	 *
	 * The value is the last part of your own class name and it's case sensitive,
	 * so take care that the configuration value is exactly named like the last
	 * part of the class name.
	 *
	 * The allowed characters of the class name are A-Z, a-z and 0-9. No other
	 * characters are possible! You should always start the last part of the class
	 * name with an upper case character and continue only with lower case characters
	 * or numbers. Avoid chamel case names like "MyCheckout"!

	/** client/html/checkout/standard/subparts
	 * List of HTML sub-clients rendered within the checkout standard section
	 *
	 * The output of the frontend is composed of the code generated by the HTML
	 * clients. Each HTML client can consist of serveral (or none) sub-clients
	 * that are responsible for rendering certain sub-parts of the output. The
	 * sub-clients can contain HTML clients themselves and therefore a
	 * hierarchical tree of HTML clients is composed. Each HTML client creates
	 * the output that is placed inside the container of its parent.
	 *
	 * At first, always the HTML code generated by the parent is printed, then
	 * the HTML code of its sub-clients. The order of the HTML sub-clients
	 * determines the order of the output of these sub-clients inside the parent
	 * container. If the configured list of clients is
	 *
	 *  array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
	 *
	 * you can easily change the order of the output by reordering the subparts:
	 *
	 *  client/html/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
	 *
	 * You can also remove one or more parts if they shouldn't be rendered:
	 *
	 *  client/html/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1" )
	 *
	 * As the clients only generates structural HTML, the layout defined via CSS
	 * should support adding, removing or reordering content by a fluid like
	 * design.
