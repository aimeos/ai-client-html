	 * Each default HTML client can be replace by an alternative imlementation.
	 * To use this implementation, you have to set the last part of the class
	 * name as configuration value so the client factory knows which class it
	 * has to instantiate.
	 *
	 * For example, if the name of the default class is
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Client\Html\Account\Profile\Standard
	 *
	 * and you want to replace it with your own version named
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Client\Html\Account\Profile\Myprofile
	 *
	 * then you have to set the this configuration option:
	 *
	 *  client/html/account/profile/name = Myprofile
	 *
	 * The value is the last part of your own class name and it's case sensitive,
	 * so take care that the configuration value is exactly named like the last
	 * part of the class name.
	 *
	 * The allowed characters of the class name are A-Z, a-z and 0-9. No other
	 * characters are possible! You should always start the last part of the class
	 * name with an upper case character and continue only with lower case characters
	 * or numbers. Avoid chamel case names like "MyProfile"!
