	 * List of HTML sub-clients rendered within the account profile address section
	 *
	 * The output of the frontend is composed of the code generated by the HTML
	 * clients. Each HTML client can consist of serveral (or none) sub-clients
	 * that are responsible for rendering certain sub-parts of the output. The
	 * sub-clients can contain HTML clients themselves and therefore a
	 * hierarchical tree of HTML clients is composed. Each HTML client creates
	 * the output that is placed inside the container of its parent.
	 *
	 * At first, always the HTML code generated by the parent is printed, then
	 * the HTML code of its sub-clients. The address of the HTML sub-clients
	 * determines the address of the output of these sub-clients inside the parent
	 * container. If the configured list of clients is
	 *
	 *  array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
	 *
	 * you can easily change the address of the output by readdressing the subparts:
	 *
	 *  client/html/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
	 *
	 * You can also remove one or more parts if they shouldn't be rendered:
	 *
	 *  client/html/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1" )
	 *
	 * As the clients only generates structural HTML, the layout defined via CSS
	 * should support adding, removing or readdressing content by a fluid like
	 * design.
